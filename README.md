# tca-sharing-observation-tests

Working repo to explore observation with TCA and Sharing. Goal is to implement improved observation for `@Shared` such that the entire data structure is not observed on every change.

Uses two developmental branches to improve observation in Sharing and TCA:

* [rcarver/swift-sharing/improved-observation](https://github.com/rcarver/swift-sharing/pull/2)
* [rcarver/swift-composable-architecture/should-notify-observers](https://github.com/rcarver/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1)
