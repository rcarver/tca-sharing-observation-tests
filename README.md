# tca-sharing-observation-tests

Working repo to explore observation with TCA and Sharing. Goal is to implement improved observation for `@Shared` such that the entire data structure is not observed on every change.

Make sure to use the `improved-observation` branch of `swift-sharing` https://github.com/rcarver/swift-sharing/pull/2
